1.22    2004-10-03 1945EST

        * In new(), the 'config' and 'output' parameters must now be
          the first and (still optionally) second parameters
          passed. This is so that they can be repeated, allowing the
          user to set their own non-special 'config' and 'output'
          parameters in the actual configuration hash.
        * Doc tweaks to reflect this as well as more general tweaks.
