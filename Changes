Revision history for Config-YAML

1.22    2004-10-03 1945EDT
        In new(), the 'config' and 'output' parameters must now be the
        first and (still optionally) second parameters passed. This is
        so that they can be repeated, allowing the user to set their
        own non-special 'config' and 'output' parameters in the actual
        configuration hash.

        Doc tweaks to reflect this as well as more general tweaks.
